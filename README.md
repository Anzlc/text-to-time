# Text to Time
A natural language to formatted time converter that interprets Slovenian time expressions. For example, if you input "pol Å¡estih popoldne," the converter will return "17:30." 
I created this project as a way to explore Neural Networks, Machine Learning, Rust, and WebAssembly.
The model currently achieves approximately 65% accuracy on test data, so its outputs may not always be precise.
